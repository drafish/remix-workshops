# Interoperability with Axelar

As the web3 world continues to grow more and more blockchains will continue to emerge. With the emergence of new ecosystems the space will continue to become fragmented unless these ecosystems can communicate with one another.

Axelar's permisionless, decentralized interoperability protocol allows for dapps across different ecosystems, the ability to add interchain functionality across any chain that is connected to Axelar.

Building a protocol that is interoperable between different ecosystems is essential for growth, as it allows your team to reach both users and liquidity on different ecosystems.
