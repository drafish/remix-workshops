As the web3 world continues to grow more and more blockchains will continue to emerge. With the emergence of new ecosystems the space will continue to become fragmented unless these ecosystems can communicate with one another.

The Axelar network enables protocols across different ecosystems the ability to add cross-chain functionality between any two blockchains.

Building a protocol that is interoperable between different ecosystems is essential for growth, as it allows your team to reach both users and liquidity on different ecosystems.
