# 这是一个关于 Remix 的 LearnEth 插件的教程仓库

### 如何使用这些教程：

**1. 打开 Remix**

https://remix.ethereum.org

**2. 在插件管理器中激活 LEARNETH**

**3. 前往 Learneth 插件， 这些教程将默认加载**

**4. You may need to sign into Github especially during an in-person workshop**

Github will block too many requests from the same location, unless you are signed into Github and have input your token.  Generally, this is only an issue during in person workshops, when there can be many requests from the same location.

To input your Github token:

```
- In one browser window - go to https://remix.ethereum.org and go to the settings tab
- In another browser window go to: 

https://github.com/settings/tokens 

and create a new token and save it in Remix in the you just opened on the settings tab.
```
